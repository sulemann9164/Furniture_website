# Furniture Website

This is a simple and modern **furniture website** I created using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The goal of this project was to practice building a responsive, clean, and user-friendly website that can showcase different types of furniture.

## What’s inside?

- **Homepage** with a beautiful banner and featured furniture.
- **Product section** to display various furniture items with images and details.
- **Navigation menu** to move around the site easily.
- **Contact section** so visitors can reach out for inquiries.
- Fully **responsive design**, so it looks good on mobiles, tablets, and desktops.
